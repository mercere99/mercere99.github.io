  <br>
    Charles Ofria is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University
    and the director of the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action.
    His research lies at the intersection of Computer Science and Evolutionary Biology, developing
    a two-way flow of ideas between the fields, with a goal of understanding how evolution produces
    complex traits, behaviors, and intelligent processes.
  <br><br>
    Dr. Ofria received a bachelor’s degree in 1994 from SUNY Stony Brook with a triple major in
    Pure Math, Applied Math, and Computer Science.  In 1999, he received a Ph.D. in Computation and
    Neural Systems from the California Institute of Technology, followed by a three-year postdoc in
    the Center for Microbial Ecology at MSU.  He has been a professor at MSU since 2002.
  <br><br>
    Dr. Ofria is the architect of the Avida Digital Evolution Research Platform, which is use in
    research and education at hundreds of universities around the world.  He is broadly interested
    in studying an harnessing evolutionary dynamics.

  <h3>Research Interests</h3>
  <p>
    Evolution is a powerful force capable of finding elegant solutions to challenges faced by
    living systems.  It has produced a wide variety of complex structures such as intricate
    gene-regulatory networks, distributed societies of cooperating eusocial insects, and
    sophisticated forms of intelligence including the human brain.  Yet all of this evolution
    comes from a single instance of life, with common ancestry and a basis in DNA, RNA, and
    proteins.  How much of the evolutionary process that we see on Earth is, in fact, universal?

    <br><br>
    One way to explore this idea is to build new forms of living systems that possess the basic
    capacity for evolution (with replication, heritable variation, and selection), but are
    otherwise distinct from life on Earth.  I conduct research with many such artificial living
    systems, where digital organisms are composed of self-replicating computer programs
    or other computational systems.  These artificial organisms allow us to simultaneously learn
    more about life as it is on Earth as we also explore “life as it could be”.
    <br><br>

    Some specific topics that I am interested in include:
    <br><br>

    <b>The evolutionary origins of biological complexity.</b> Computational evolutionary systems
    are unable to produce anywhere near the same level of complexity as what is seen in nature.
    Most of my research, in one way or another, revolves around understanding natural evolutionary
    dynamics and applying them to computational systems.  I take many different approaches,
    including using information theory or releated techniques to measure complexity, novelty,
    and open-endedness exhibited by a system.
    <br><br>

    <b>The early evolution of intelligent behaviors.</b>  Human intelligence is arguably the most
    complex evolutionary traits ever evolved; it is no surprise that developing human-level AIs
    has been such a challenge. Even so, the large-language models favored today use very different
    techniques than humans to answer questions or solve problems. Human intelligence was built
    using the materials available (cells), while computers have very different materials (logic
    circuits).  My goal is to understand how early building blocks formed the first components of
    natural intelligence and to duplicate these efforts using circle-like structures that are more
    natural for a computational environment.  As these pieces come together, they provide a
    roadmap for continued development.
    <br><br>

    <b>Major evolutionary transitions.</b> Some of the most profound evolutionary changes alter
    what it means to be an "individual" organism.  One of the most profound of these was the
    evolutionary transition from single cells to multi-cellular organisms.  While impressive
    advancements are being made in wet labs to understand these transitions, the slow nature
    of evolution makes such studies difficult, especially when looking at broad environmental
    conditions that allow for a major transition.  Digital systems allow us to investigate
    more broadly how such transitions occur, and can even given insights on coordination and
    cooperation and how they can be applied back to solve computational problems. (see next!)
    <br><br>

    <b>The evolution of coordination and cooperative behaviors.</b>  As Moore's Law has slowed
    dramatically, improvements in computational power have shifted from ever smaller and faster
    CPUs to simply using more and more CPUs.  Unfortunatley, the distributed code needed to
    take advantage of such architectures tends to not be especially intuitive.  Furthermore, 
    as the number of CPUs employed increases exponentially, so too does the chance of a single
    core failing, bringing down the whole system.  Biological organisms have proved incredibly
    robost on both of these fronts, and thus understanding more about how evolution produces
    cooperative behaviors can also allow these same techniques to be used for computational
    problem solving.

    <b>Interactions between ecological and evolutionary dynamics.</b>
    <br><br>
    
    <b>Open-ended evolutionary computation.</b><br>

  <h3>Software Projects</h3>
  In addition to a broad range of reseach projects, the Digital Evolution Lab develops and maintains
  a broad range of academic software.  These include:<br><br>
